"""
The program will read selected data from a csv file into python program and get insight about the trends of road accidents across the globe.
The Road Accidents indicator is measured in number of accidents, number of persons, per million inhabitants and million vehicles.‚Äù
The users will be able to take informed decisions based on the outputs from the program. 
The results will give each country an indicator of its road safety as a global measure.
This is a group project. The authors of the program are: @Shweta Chaurasia and @Sanskrit Singh
